A plan of my 3rd Assignemt
Attention: your terminal should be AT LEAST 95PX AT WIDTH FOR AN
APPROPRIATE WAY TO USE IT

Note: In the './add_new_movie is a realy bad code, the ./search_movie and 
./make_changes scripts code is better, bacues I did them last'

List of my scripts:
./menu_movies - main script, main menu of program
my_movies_list - file with all movies
./add_new_movie - add new movie to the file with movies
./make_changes - edit a movie from the file with movies
./read_instructions - read instructions about 'How to use program'
./search_movie - search movie by the specific patter in the file with movies
./sort_movies - look sorted information about movies
./user_recognition - script which is used for the ./read_instructions script 
		     and print the name of user which is taken from 
		     /etc/passwd file
./view_movies - view all movies from the file with movies
./delete_movies - delete movies by the specific patter
line_count_sort_movies - perl script, it counts lines in 'my_movies_list' file
		       	 and it is used in ./sort_movies script. This is
			 upgrated version of 'wc -l' command because it
			 doesn't count in file
